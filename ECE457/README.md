This work is from a course on Experimental Methods in Quantum Computing where I completed labs involving hardware such as the NMR and NV center experiemnts where I used python for to control hardware to realize single qubit experiments. I also completed a lab with qiskit and the IBM Quantum Platform to learn about superconducting qubits. My final project built upon this, in which I attempted to implement a cross resonance gate between superconducting qubits. I wrote reports on each project and they're in each folder.
