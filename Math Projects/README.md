Here I've put some writeups of my math research I completed in high school. The topics include number theory and analysis. The analysis project was done as part of a program where I was mentored by a Dartmouth professor. I was able to write an expository paper thst got published! The other two were more passion projects to gain experience in new topics I was learning. I've also included some expository writeups of final projects from graduate courses involving Quantum Information Theory and Algorithm Design, and I've included a presentation I made on Algebraic Number Theory that I gave to high school students at a summer camp.
