Here I've put some writeups of my math research I completed in high school. The topics include number theory and analysis. The analysis project was done as part of a program where I was mentored by a Dartmouth professor. I was able to write an expository paper that got published! The other two were more passion projects (Chains of Congruences and Smith Normal Forms of Powers of Matrices) to gain experience in new topics I was learning. I've also included some expository writeups of final projects from graduate courses involving Quantum Information Theory (Automorphism Codes) and Algorithm Design (COS521 Project), and I've included a presentation I made on Algebraic Number Theory that I gave to high school students at a summer camp.
