This is some initial work I completed as part of a Quantum Machine Learning REU! I was trying to develop machine learning models with quantum computing for image generation tasks. To get started, I focused on generating images based on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of digits. I haven't uploaded bulletproof code since my results from this project are proprietary and are currently in the process of being submitted for publishing! As a result, you'll find many failed attempts (autoencoders and diffusion) and some good attempts that didn't make it into my final work (GANs). As consolation, I've attached my final writeup of my work and my final presentation!
