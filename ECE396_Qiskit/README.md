Here you'll find coding projects from my introductory Quantum Computing course. In these assignments, I used IBM's qiskit to answer questions about Grover's algorithm and Bitflip Error Correcting Codes. I also completed a final project on Quantum Machine Learning, where I compared SVM with Quantum SVM. In this project, I learned about Variational Quantum Circuits and Quantum Neural Networks.
